               <h3>Reason to be</h3>
               <p>
                  Yeah it's just another note taking app, but did you look at it? Cats! I mean... Do you need a better reason? I don't think so. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  But if you insist...
               </p>
               <p>
                  There are so many note-taking apps in the market nowadays... And they tend to offer a little bit too many options, and you may actually not need them. Many, many times, less is more. So We decided to make it simple for you. Stick with what you really need: know what you have to do.

                  <h3>OneNote by Microsoft</h3>

                  <p>
                     OneNote is a versatile note-taking app that combines the functionality of a traditional notebook with the flexibility of a digital workspace. It allows you to jot down ideas, create checklists, and even insert images, tables, and other multimedia elements directly into your notes.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                     <p><strong>key features of OneNote include: </strong></p>
                     <li>A multi-layer interface with three levels: each page is a canvas for your notes, grouped into sections comprising a notebook. This layout might take some getting used to, but advanced users might appreciate it due to its robust organization.</li>

                     <li>Superior rich text editing and media capabilities compared to Google Keep. You can import meeting details directly from the Outlook calendar and add hyperlinks to your notes.</li>

                     <li>Organization of notes into sections and notebooks by default. You can move notes between sections and notebooks, giving you control over how your notes are categorized.</li>

                     <li>Mobile-friendly app with a clean interface and intuitive features.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                     On the other hand, OneNote has its own set of limitations. It only offers local storage under Windows, which can be restrictive for users who need to access their notes from different devices. There are also text editing issues in OneNote. If you annotate a photo or some text, then insert some text above it, the annotations don't necessarily move with the photo and can become misplaced. Finally, OneNote has a somewhat outdated look and can sometimes feel overcrowded.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Keep by Google</h3>

                  <p>
                     Google Keep is a simple yet powerful note-taking app that's designed for quick, easy access to your notes. It's particularly useful for jotting down to-do items, creating checklists, and capturing quick ideas.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                     <p><strong>key features of OneNote include: </strong></p>
                     <li>A clean interface with notes displayed as widgets in the main window. You can compose a new note using the bar placed above the existing ones, and you'll see options to add an image or checklist.</li>

                     <li>Limited rich text editing and media capabilities compared to OneNote. However, it does allow you to add images, drawings, checklists, and voice notes.</li>

                     <li>Centralized organization of notes on the main screen with features to sort them. You can assign labels that act as folders and display them in the left-hand menu. Google Keep also lets you set colours and backgrounds of your notes.</li>

                     <li>Mobile-friendly app with a similar layout to the web version. It provides quick actions for creating a note and accessing different labels.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                     Google Keep has some limitations that can affect its usability. For instance, it doesn't allow users to organize their notes into folders, which can lead to a cluttered user interface and make navigation difficult. Additionally, some users have reported issues with data synchronization, including delays and the return of old or deleted items. Lastly, the text editing experience in Google Keep is not ideal. When users click in the middle of a note, a text box is created in the middle, which can result in an empty note with an empty text box at the bottom right.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Notes by Apple</h3>

                  <p>
                     Apple Notes is a straightforward note-taking app that's integrated seamlessly with the rest of the Apple ecosystem. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a good choice for those who prefer simplicity over complexity.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                     <p><strong>key features of OneNote include: </strong></p>
                     <li>Integration with other Apple services like Siri, Shortcuts, and the Apple Watch.</li>

                     <li>Support for rich text and images.</li>

                     <li>Ability to organize notes into folders and subfolders.</li>

                     <li>Syncing across all your Apple devices.</li>

                     <li>Sharing options with others.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                     Apple Notes also has its own set of limitations. While you can share individual notes, you can't share collections or notebooks with others. Unlike some other note-taking apps, Apple Notes doesn't support rich text editing, which means you can't change the font size or style, apply bold or italics, etc., within a single note. These features, which are available in many other note-taking apps, are missing from Apple Notes. Another limitation is that Apple Notes does not support colour-coding or tagging, which can be useful for organizing notes.
